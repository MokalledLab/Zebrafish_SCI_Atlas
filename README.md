This repository contains all the codes that are used in the manuscript titled "Single-cell analysis of innate spinal cord regeneration identifies intersecting modes of neuronal repair" by Saraswathy VM et al. Following is the abstract of our study,


Adult zebrafish have an innate ability to recover from severe spinal cord injury. Here, we report a comprehensive single nuclear RNA sequencing atlas that spans 6 weeks of regeneration. We identify cooperative roles for adult neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity during spinal cord repair. Neurogenesis of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons restores the excitatory/inhibitory balance after injury. In addition, transient populations of injury-responsive neurons (iNeurons) show elevated plasticity between 1 and 3 weeks post-injury. Using cross-species transcriptomics and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, we found iNeurons are injury-surviving neurons that share transcriptional similarities with a rare population of spontaneously plastic mouse neurons. iNeurons are required for functional recovery and employ vesicular trafficking as an essential mechanism that underlies neuronal plasticity. This study provides a comprehensive resource of the cells and mechanisms that direct spinal cord regeneration and establishes zebrafish as a model of plasticity-driven neural repair.
